Although the plaque on the outside of the house claims that Sir Christopher Wren lived there during the building of St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, the house was built in the same year that the cathedral was completed, making it unlikely that Wren could have stayed on the site to watch his masterpiece take shape across the river, but the presence of the plaque is likely to have saved the house from being torn down, and the site redeveloped, after the war.ï»¿</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Globe Theatre is a reconstruction of the original open air playhouse that was originally built in 1599 by Shakespeare&rsquo;s playing company, The Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Men. The Globe was constructed using timber from an earlier theatre, The Theatre in Shoreditch; after a dispute over the lease of the land on which the theatre stood, the company leased a plot of land on the other side of the river, dismantled the theatre beam by beam and carried the timber across the river to the new site.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The original Globe theatre was destroyed by fire on the 29 June, 1613 after wadding from a stage cannon ignited the thatched roof during a performance of Henry VIII. The theatre was quickly rebuilt &ndash; this time with a tiled roof &ndash; but, like all the other theatres in London, was closed down by the Puritans in 1642. It was demolished to make room for tenements in 1644.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The current Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe opened in 1997 with a production of Henry V, and was built approximately 230&nbsp;metres (750&nbsp;ft) from the site of the original theatre. The American actor, director and producer Sam Wanamaker founded the Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe Trust in 1970 with the objective of building a faithful recreation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe close to its original Bankside location but died in 1993, at which point the site had been secured, the exhibition undercroft was structurally complete and a few timber bays of the theatre were in place.</span></p>',0,0,1,1,1),(14,'Southwark Cathedral/ London Bridge',51.5061,-0.0897733,'<p>Southwark Cathedral has been a place of worship for over a thousand years &ndash; the first written reference to it is the mention of a \'minster\' in the Domesday Book in 1068 &ndash; although it only became a cathedral in 1905. William Shakespeare buried his brother, Edmund, here in 1607: the grave is unmarked, but there is a commemorative stone in the paving of the choir which was placed there at a later date. The Cathedral also contains a large 19th century stained glass window dedicated to Shakespeare, depicting scenes from all of his plays, at the base of which is a statue of a reclining William Shakespeare holding a quill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A ten minute stroll from Southwark Cathedral &ndash; longer if you call into Borough Market on your way for some reviving food and drink &ndash; lies the church of St George the Martyr where the eponymous heroine of Charles Dickens&rsquo; <em>Little Dorrit</em> marries: there is a small representation of her in the east window of the church. Dickens&rsquo; father was imprisoned for debt in the Marshalsea prison and the surviving wall of the prison adjoins the north side of the churchyard. Little Dorrit Court and Little Dorrit Playground can be seen on your right as you walk down to the church along Borough High Street. On the way back up from the church towards London Bridge you pass by Talbot Yard, which was once home to The Tabard &ndash; the inn in which Chaucer&rsquo;s pilgrims first meet on their journey to Canterbury.</p>',0,0,1,1,1),(16,'London Bridge/ Monument',51.5102,-0.0859246,'<p>A bridge has existed on the same site for at least the past two thousand years: the first bridge across the Thames was built by the Romans in around 50 AD and was made of wood. The southern gatehouse of a later incarnation of the bridge, the Stone Gateway, became notorious as the site where traitor&rsquo;s heads were displayed, dipped in tar to preserve them against the elements and then impaled on spikes. The first head displayed was that of William Wallace in 1305 and the practice continued for another 350 years until it was stopped by Charles II, following his restoration to the throne.&nbsp; A stone bridge was opened in 1831 to replace the crumbling 600 year old stone bridge, and it is likely that it was this bridge on which Nancy met Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie in <em>Oliver Twist</em>, and which Pip walked over in despair after discovering that Estella was engaged to marry Bentley Drummle in <em>Great Expectations</em>. In 1896, it was estimated that the bridge was the busiest point in London, with 8,000 people crossing the bridge by foot and 900 crossing in vehicles every hour. The current London Bridge was opened in 1973 and the steps on the west side of the bridge are known as Nancy&rsquo;s Steps after the character in <em>Oliver Twist</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Feeling inspired by all these literary connections? Before you cross over the river to our final stop, why not cross over the bridge towards London Bridge station, walk down Tooley Street and take the third road on your left, Hay&rsquo;s Lane, where you&rsquo;ll find Hays Galleria &ndash; home to the independent bookshop, Riverside Bookshop.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Across the bridge, on the other side of the river,</span><span class=\"s1\">stands the Monument to the Great Fire of London</span><span class=\"s2\">. It was built between 1671 and 1677 and</span><span class=\"s1\"> stands at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill; another monument, the Golden Boy of Pye Corner, marks the point near Smithfield where the fire stopped. The Monument is 61 metres high (202 feet) &ndash; the exact distance between it and the site in Pudding Lane where the fire began. </span><span class=\"s2\">Charles Dickens described the appearance of the Monument in <em>Martin Chuzzlewit</em>:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">&lsquo;If the day were bright, you observed upon the house&ndash;tops, stretching far away, a long dark path; the shadow of the Monument; and turning round, the tall original was close beside you, with every hair erect upon his golden head, as if the doings of the city frightened him.&rsquo;</span></p>',0,0,1,1,1),(18,'Piccadilly',51.5092,-0.136805,'<p>Piccadilly was originally known as Portugal Street; it is believed that its new name, the name we use to this day, arose as a result of the success of a tailor called Robert Baker, who owned a shop on the Strand at the end of the sixteenth century. Baker amassed a considerable fortune through making and then selling <em>piccadills</em>, which were stiff collars with scalloped edges and a lace border, and went on to buy what was then open countryside to the west of London, where he built a large mansion which soon became known as Piccadilly Hall. Charles Dickens Junior, son of the famous author, described the road as: \'the great thoroughfare leading from the Haymarket and Regent-street westward to Hyde Park-corner, [it] is the nearest approach to the Parisian boulevard of which London can boast.\'</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As one of the richest and most famous streets in London, Piccadilly unsurprisingly has a strong literary heritage: in Bram Stoker\'s novel, <em>Dracula</em>, the count owns a house in Piccadilly and P. G. Wodehouse&rsquo;s charming hero, Bertie Wooster lived just off Piccadilly, in Half Moon Street, and his club, the Drones Club, was based in Dover Street, while Margery Allingham\'s detective Albert Campion lived in a flat on Piccadilly.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Luxury department store Fortnum and Mason, which was opened in 1707, is a useful place to stop and browse for ingredients for a picnic to enjoy later in St James&rsquo;s Park, before moving on to browse through Hatchards, London\'s oldest surviving bookshop.&nbsp; Booksellers since 1797, Hatchards\' customers have included the great and the good, from Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to writer Rudyard Kipling, and the shop is a must-visit for any book-lover.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A few minutes walk away from Hatchards sits St James&rsquo; Church, which was consecrated on 13 July, 1684 and is said to be the favourite church of its architect, Sir Christopher Wren. Carvings by acclaimed sculptor and wood carver, Grinling Gibbons can be seen on the altar and the organ, and Gibbons also carved the font of the church, in which the poet William Blake was baptised.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Piccadilly was also once home to Simpsons of Piccadilly, a quality clothing store which first opened for business in April 1936: when it opened, it claimed to be the largest menswear store in London, and possibly even the world. For Simpson\'s opening day, designer Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, a Hungarian refugee from Nazi Germany, furnished the fifth floor with three full-sized aircraft as part of an in-store aviation theme. The building was sold to the Waterstone\'s chain of booksellers in 1999, and it is now their flagship store and the largest book store in Europe. The bar on the fifth floor 5</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> View offers visitors views across London towards Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, the last stop on our walk. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you were to carry on down Piccadilly, beyond Waterstones, you would reach Piccadilly Circus, home to what is popularly known as the Eros Statue, although it is actually a statue of his brother Anteros, The God of Selfless Love, which was erected in memory of the Victorian philanthropist Lord Shaftesbury. The Criterion Theatre, on Piccadilly Circus, is where John Watson first heard of Sherlock Holmes, while the Caf&eacute; Royal on nearby Regent Street is where Holmes was attacked in &lsquo;The Adventure of the Illustrious Client&rsquo;</span></p>',0,0,1,1,1),(19,'St James\'s Square and St James\'s Park',51.507,-0.135749,'<p>St James\' Square Gardens, to the south of Piccadilly, is home to the London Library, the world&rsquo;s largest independent lending library. The Library was founded in 1841by Thomas Carlyle and briefly occupied the first floor of the Traveller&rsquo;s Club in Pall Mall, before moving to its current home in 1845.&nbsp; Past presidents and vice-presidents of the Library include Rudyard Kipling, Tennyson, T. S. Eliot and Isaiah Berlin and the Library&rsquo;s current president is Tom Stoppard. AS Byatt&rsquo;s Booker prize-winning novel, <em>Possession</em> opens in the London Library:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&lsquo;The London Library was Roland&rsquo;s favourite place. It was shabby but civilised, alive with history but inhabited also by living poets and thinkers who could be found squatting on the slotted metal floor of the stacks, or arguing pleasantly at the turn of the stair. Here Carlyle had come, here George Eliot had progressed through bookshelves. Roland saw her black silk skirts, her velvet trains, sweeping compressed between the Fathers of the Church, and heard her firm foot ring on metal among the German poets&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To the south of St James&rsquo;s Square lies Pall Mall, the first public street in the world to be artificially lit with gas, and beyond it, St James&rsquo;s Park. St James&rsquo;s Park is the oldest Royal Park in London; Henry VIII purchased the land from Eton College in 1532 and when King James I ascended the throne in 1603 he ordered that the land be drained and landscaped. James kept exotic animals, including camels and crocodiles, in the park and it wasn&rsquo;t until Charles II took the throne that the park was opened to the public. The colony of pelicans that live in the park date back to a gift from the Russian ambassador in 1664.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Inn in the Park is open all year round for food and drink, but on a sunny day why not bring your own picnic and enjoy a view of either Buckingham Palace or Whitehall as you eat?</span></p>',0,0,1,1,1),(20,'Westminster Abbey',51.5018,-0.129626,'<p>At the edge of St James&rsquo;s Park lies the Churchill War Rooms, one of the five branches of the Imperial War Museum. The museum contains the Cabinet War Rooms, in which Churchill announced &lsquo;This is the room from which I will direct the war\' as well as the Churchill Museum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A few minutes walk from the Churchill War Rooms, by way of Parliament Square, which contains statues of many famous statesman including Benjamin Disraeli and Abraham Lincoln, lie our final points of interest: Westminster Abbey and Big Ben. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Westminster Abbey is one of the most important Gothic buildings in the country.&nbsp; Benedictine monks first came to the site in the middle of the tenth century; the Abbey, officially the Collegiate Church of St. Peter, Westminster, has been the coronation church since 1066 and is the final resting place of seventeen monarchs and countless aristocrats and authors.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Poets&rsquo; Corner lies in the South Transept of the Abbey &ndash; Chaucer was buried here in 1400 as a result of his employment as Clerk of the King&rsquo;s Works but 150 years later his remains were moved into the magnificent tomb that can be seen today. Poet Edmund Spenser was laid to rest near Chaucer&rsquo;s tomb and other poets and prose authors, including Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Jane Austen and Henry James, were buried or memorialised near the two great poets. Many of the memorials happened some time after the death of the writer &ndash; Lord Byron died in 1824 and was only given a memorial in 1969 and even Shakespeare had to wait until 1740 before he was granted a monument. An effigy of Oliver Cromwell was originally buried here after an elaborate funeral &ndash; Cromwell&rsquo;s religious principles dictated that his burial be without ceremony so his body was buried privately in a vault &ndash; but when Charles II was restored to the throne he had Cromwell disinterred and posthumously hanged, before his head was cut off and stuck on a spike.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Although Big Ben is often used to refer to the whole clock, the name officially refers to the largest bell within the clock that stands at the north end of the Palace of Westminster.&nbsp; It is the largest four-faced chiming clock in the world and was completed in 1858.&nbsp; In <em>Mrs Dalloway</em> Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s eponymous heroine reflects that:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">&lsquo;For having lived in Westminster &ndash; how many years now? over twenty &ndash; one feels even in the midst of traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they say, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes. There! Out it boomed. First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable.&rsquo;</span></p>',0,0,1,1,1),(21,'30 Bedford Square and Gower Street',51.519,-0.131385,'<p>Number 30 Bedford Square is the original home of Jonathan Cape so a fitting start to this walk in an area so steeped in literary history. Cape was founded in 1921 by Jonathan Cape and Wren Howard.&nbsp;The firm quickly established itself as one of the leading literary publishers in London, publishing T.E. Lawrence&rsquo;s The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Ernest Hemingway, Arthur Ransome&rsquo;s Swallows and Amazons (all the books in the series are still in print today in the original editions) and, in 1953, Ian Fleming\'s Casino Royale, the first of the James Bond books.</p>\r\n<p>Gower Street runs along the Eastern side of the Square and it is at 110 Gower Street (formerly 12 Upper Gower Street) that Charles Darwin lived between 1838 and 1842, where he wrote part of <em>The Origin of Species</em>. The house is now the UCL Darwin Building. Darwin christened the house \"Macaw Cottage\" because of the &ldquo;gaudy colours&rdquo; of the furnishings. By the time he came to Gower Street, Darwin had already returned from his famous voyage on HMS Beagle and it was in this house that Darwin&rsquo;s theory of Natural Selection made progress but it was not until 1859, when the he and his family had moved out to Kent that <em>On the Origin of Species was published.</em> 1,250 copies were sold on the first day of its publication</p>\r\n<p>It is also worth noting that No. 7 Gower Street was once the house of John Millais\'s parents and the birthplace of the artistic movement the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.</p>',0,0,1,1,1),(22,'Tavistock Square ',51.5245,-0.128231,'<p>The Tavistock hotel stands on the site of what was once 52 Tavistock Square, the home of Virginia and Leonard Woolf and the Hogarth Press from 1923 until it was destroyed by a bomb in World War II. Virginia wrote most of her greatest novels here - Mrs Dalloway, To The Lighthouse, Orlando (which was inspired by her affair with Vita Sackville West in the twenties), The Waves, and The Years. The couple ran the Hogarth Press in the basement of No. 52 and published some of the most significant writers of the 20th Century including Freud, T.S. Eliot, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Katherine Mansfield, E.M Forster, Christopher Isherwood and countless others. The first publications were hand-set using boxes of type but as the press grew they were able to afford more sophisticated printing equipment. Particularly distinctive were the book jackets designed by other Bloomsbury Group members such as Vanessa Bell and Dora Carrington. It was in nearby Gordon Square where the Bloomsbury Group was formed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Dickens also lived in old Tavistock House (now the BMA building), between 1851 and 1860. It was here that he wrote Bleak House, Little Dorritt, Hard Times, A Tale of Two Cities and part of Great Expectations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Walking through the gardens you will see a memorial to Virginia Woolf in the South West corner of the square and there is a Gingko Biloba tree dedicated to Leonard Woolf. At the centre of the garden is a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. There is also a cherry tree planted in memory of the victims of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and a memorial to Conscientious Objectors. Tavistock Square was designed in the 1820s by the architect Thomas Cubitt and is part of an estate owned by the Duke of Bedford.</p>',0,0,1,1,1),(23,'The Foundling Hospital',51.5236,-0.119486,'<p>Founded in 1742, The Foundling Hospital was a place where unwanted children such as street children and orphans could be left and it was the first of its kind. It was founded by the campaigner and philanthropist Thomas Coram. In 18<span class=\"s1\">th </span>century London huge numbers of children were abandoned or thrown on the mercies of the parish church who were paid a lump sum by the parents to take them on, but many died in the parish poor houses or workhouses. At this time <span class=\"s2\">over 74% of children born in London died before they were five. In workhouses the death rate increased to over 90%. Coram was horrified by the fate of poor children in London and campaigned tirelessly to establish the hospital and despite much opposition on the basis the hospital would encourage prostitution and immorality the first children were admitted in 1741. Dickens based his character Mr Brownlow, who takes Oliver Twist into his care, on Coram.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The hospital soon became London&rsquo;s most popular charity. William Hogarth became a governor, designing the uniforms and coat of arms as well as fostering children. Hogarth and other British artists donated art work to the hospital and in a sense it became the first gallery of contemporary British art. You can view the incredible collection of art in the museum today. The composer Handel was also a governor and benefactor, composing the Foundling anthem. <span class=\"s3\">Annual performances of the Messiah provided vital sources of income for the Hospital and he bequeathed the manuscript to the hospital. The Museum holds the Gerald Coke Handel Collection, an internationally important collection of material relating to Handel and his contemporaries, including manuscripts, printed books and music, libretti, paintings and engravings, memorabilia, art works and ephemera.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">In front of the hospital is Coram Fields which is a playground and park for children. Sadly adults can&rsquo;t enter the park unless accompanied by children.<br /></span></p>',0,0,1,1,1),(24,'Great Ormond Street Children\'s Hospital',51.5219,-0.120354,'<p>Great Ormond Street Hospital was founded in 1842 as the first hospital specifically for children. Dickens was an active fundraiser and J.M. Barrie donated the copyright of his book Peter Pan to the hospital. When the rights expired in 1987 the government granted the hospital a perpetual right to collect royalties for public performances, commercial publication, or other communications to the public of the work.</p>\r\n<p>If you are in need of a drink you might like to stop at The Lamb, a historic pub on nearby Lamb&rsquo;s Conduit Street which was once the meeting place for the Bloomsbury Group.</p>',-71.6,8.6,1,1,1),(25,'St George\'s Church, Bloomsbury',51.5176,-0.124482,'<p>Commissioned as part of the 1711 Act of Parliament for building Fifty New Churches, St George&rsquo;s was designed by baroque architect Hawskmoor (the sixth and last of his London churches). It was built in 1730 in the parish of St Giles in the Fields which was considered much in need of a place of worship.</p>\r\n<p>In 1913, the funeral of the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison was held in this church. Emily was killed when she threw herself in front of the king\'s horse at Epsom racecourse during the Derby to protest the right for women to vote. Her funeral was attended by thousands of women, all wearing black and purple, green and white (the colours of the suffragette movement).</p>\r\n<p>The novelist Antony Trollope was baptised here in 1834 and Charles Dickens used St George\'s as the setting for \"The Bloomsbury Christening\" in Sketches by Boz.</p>\r\n<p>The church has only recently been reopened after undergoing extensive restoration after it fell into disrepair in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>',0,0,1,1,1),(26,'The British Museum',51.5183,-0.126117,'<p>The British Museum, which first opened to the public in 1759 in Montagu House, is at the heart of Bloomsbury. The Reading Room opened on 2 May 1857 and its design was inspired by the domed Pantheon in Rome. Bookstacks made of iron were built surrounding the new Reading Room to take the weight of the books and protect them against fire. In all they contained three miles of bookcases and twenty-five miles of shelves. The books have since been moved to the British Library and the room was opened to the public for the first time in 2000.</p>\r\n<p>Those wanting to use the Reading Room had to apply in writing and were issued a reader&rsquo;s ticket by the Principal Librarian. Among those granted tickets were Karl Marx, Lenin (who signed in under the name Jacob Richter), Bram Stoker, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Virginia Woolf, Oscar Wilde, H.G. Wells, Mark Twain, and George Orwell. David Lodge&rsquo;s protagonist Adam Appleby in the novel The British Museum is Falling Down spends much of his time trying but failing to get down to his PhD dissertation work.</p>',0,0,1,1,1),(27,'Bond Street',51.5116,-0.143287,'<p>Our walk begins in Bond Street, where Virginia Woolf\'s heroine Mrs Dalloway buys her gloves in the short story \'Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street&rsquo;, taken from the collection <em>Mrs Dalloway\'s Party</em>. Technically, Bond Street itself doesn\'t exist: the road is instead divided into two sections, New Bond Street to the North and Old Bond Street to the South. The road is named after the seventeenth century nobleman, Sir Thomas Bond, who was one of a consortium of investors who bought Clarendon House &ndash; described as one of the first great classical houses in London &ndash; before demolishing it and building Dover Street,&nbsp; Albermale Street and Old Bond Street on the site. Clarendon House would have originally faced directly down St James\'s Street.</p>',0,0,1,1,1),(28,'Highgate Cemetery',51.5567,-0.201824,'<p>This intriguing Victorian cemetery is the final stop on this walk and the final resting place of among others George Eliot (though her grave name is Mary Ann Cross), Douglas Adams, Radclyffe Hall, Christina Rossetti,&nbsp; most of Charles Dickens&rsquo; family and of course Karl Marx.&nbsp; The cemetery was opened in 1839 to deal with the crisis in the lack of adequate burial spaces due to an increase in the mortality rate. Previously grave yards and burial grounds were crammed in between shops, houses and taverns wherever there was space. Highgate was to be one of seven large cemeteries to be built around London to ease the problem.&nbsp; The abundance of ornate gothic tombs and buildings very much reflect the fashion of the time.&nbsp; This atmospheric place has featured in many novels and films, most notably in Bram Stoker&rsquo;s Dracula: the Count\'s young victim, Lucy Westenra, is buried in Highgate Cemetery, where she later preys on young children as a vampire. The French crime writer Fred Vargas also chose the cemetery for the opening of her novel An Uncertain Place.&nbsp; Audrey Niffenegger set her novel Her Fearful Symmetry in and around the cemetery and the author acted as a tour guide whilst carrying out her research. For a taste of Audrey&rsquo;s tour we&rsquo;ve included a video of the author at the cemetery.</p>',0,0,1,1,1);
