To install simply move htdocs to your public html directory, then set BOILER_LOCATION on line 3 of index to point to the framework folder.

Controllers are the start point of your page.

Testing and Building
====================

Building and testing (optional) is done with a build.xml make file for "ant". You may also consider using the following to help test your code.

The following tools have a config shipped with ant targets, and are fully compatible with Hudson/Jenkins CI

* PHP Mess Detector 

pear channel-discover pear.phpmd.org 
pear channel-discover pear.pdepend.org 
pear install --alldeps phpmd/PHP_PMD
 
* PHP CodeSniffer

pear install PHP_CodeSniffer

* PHP Copy and Paste detector

pear channel-discover components.ez.no
pear install phpunit/phpcpd

* PHPUnit

pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com
pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

* PHPUnit skelgen

pear install phpunit/PHPUnit_SkeletonGenerator


CONTROLLERS
===========

-Namespacing follows folder structure to allow PHP lazy loading (please see php.net for Namespacing and __autoload)
-All classes must be namespaced with Controller. This is to allow you to have a controller and model, for example, with the same name.
-Functions being called must be public
-First letter only of class is capitalized

Examples:

http://localhost/class/function/args1/args2/args3

Would execute:
$c = new \Controller\Class();
$c->function(args1, args2, args3);

http://localhost/ns1/ns2/ns3/class/function

Would Execute:
$c = new \Controller\ns1\ns2\ns3\Class();
$c->function();


MODELS
======

-Models should extend DBObject normally for MySQL objects
-Models must be namespaced
-DBObject class (found in application/model/DBObject.php) must have login details entered for PHP

<?php
namespace Model;
class MySQLTable extends DBObject {
	public static function getTable($read=true) {
		return "mysql_table_name";
	}
	
	public static function getPrimaryKey() {
		return "mysql_primary_key";
		OR
		return array("concat", "key");
	}
}
//That's it! No SQL! Your MySQL settings are retrieved from a config.php file, built by ant. This stops you committing your MySQL details to git - pretty irritating!
?>







More advanced functions:
N.B. This is a demo which came from when the framework was not namespaced.
